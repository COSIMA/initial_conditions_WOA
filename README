Commands and code to generate initial condition files for 3 MOM ocean grids from 
World Ocean Atlas 13 (WOA) data.

Each directory contains a script, makeic which uses Nic Hannah's ocean-ic code 
to interpolate the salt and temperature fields on to the 3D MOM ocean grids.

Run

./make_inital_conditions.sh

to generate initial conditions files for all three grids
