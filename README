Commands and code to generate initial condition files for 3 MOM ocean grids from 
World Ocean Atlas 13 (WOA) data, for example as generated by
https://github.com/COSIMA/initial_conditions_access-om2

To clone the directory and its supporting python programs:


git clone --recursive https://github.com/COSIMA/initial_conditions_WOA.git


Each directory contains a script, makeic which uses Nic Hannah's ocean-ic code 
to interpolate the salt and temperature fields on to the 3D MOM ocean grids.


To generate initial conditions files for all three grids run


./make_inital_conditions.sh
